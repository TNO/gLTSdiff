# Example: multiple inputs
This example demonstrates how to apply gLTSdiff on more than two inputs. For that we use feature models, which are LTSs where the transitions are annotated with a feature (number). We construct three such feature models, whose DOT/SVG visualizations can be found in the `input` folder. Then we compare the structures of these feature models, and compute a single feature model that shows how the three input feature models relate. This combined feature model can be found in the `output` folder.
