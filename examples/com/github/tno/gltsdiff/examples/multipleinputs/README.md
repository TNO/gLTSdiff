# Example: multiple inputs
This example demonstrates how to apply gLTSdiff on more than two inputs.
For that we use version-annotated GLTSs, which are GLTSs where the transitions are annotated with a version (number).
We construct three such models as input, whose DOT/SVG visualizations can be found in the `input` folder.
Then we compare the structures of these models, and compute a single model that shows how the three input models relate.
This combined model can be found in the `output` folder.
