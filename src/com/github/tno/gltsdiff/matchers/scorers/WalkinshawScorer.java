/**
 * Contains common functionality for the state similarity scoring approaches that are described in the article by
 * Walkinshaw et al. (TOSEM 2013). However, this implementation generalizes the approaches described in the article by a
 * more general concept of combinability (see {@link Combiner}).
 * <p>
 * The equation system as described by Walkinshaw et al. produces similarity scores guaranteed to be in the range
 * [-1,1]. This implementation converts all negative similarity scores to {@link Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY} instead after
 * having solved the equation systems, indicating to the {@link Matcher matchers} that the corresponding state pair is
 * incompatible and should never be merged (which is in line with StateChum). So the scores computed by this
 * implementation are guaranteed to be either {@link Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY} or be in the range [0,1].
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <S> The type of state properties.
 * @param <T> The type of transition properties.
