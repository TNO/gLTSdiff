# gLTSdiff: Generalized LTS differencing
gLTSdiff is a library for comparing the structures of two or more generalized labeled transition systems (GLTSs), and merging them into a single combined GLTS, for example with colors that indicate how the structures of the input GLTSs relate. This implementation is inspired by, and generalizes the LTSdiff algorithm proposed by Neil Walkinshaw and Kirill Bogdanov in their TOSEM'13 article titled "Automated Comparison of State-Based Software Models in Terms of Their Language and Structure" (see also [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/2430545.2430549)). Moreover, gLTSdiff implementation comes with significant performance improvements over LTSdiff.
