# gLTSdiff: Generalized LTS differencing
gLTSdiff is a library for comparing the structures of two or more Labeled Transition Systems (LTSs), and merging them into a single combined LTS, for example with colors that indicate how the structures of the input LTSs relate. This implementation is inspired by, and generalizes the LTSdiff algorithm proposed by Neil Walkinshaw and Kirill Bogdanov in their TOSEM'13 article titled "Automated Comparison of State-Based Software Models in Terms of Their Language and Structure" (see also [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/2430545.2430549)). Moreover, gLTSdiff implementation comes with significant performance improvements over LTSdiff.
